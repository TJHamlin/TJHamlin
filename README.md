- 👋 Kia ora, I’m @TJHamlin
- 👀 I’m generally interested in quantitative ecology, with somewhat of a focus on animal movements and population modelling. Most of my work revolves around seabirds and pest species.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning state-space modelling and Bayesian statistics.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ecological research.
