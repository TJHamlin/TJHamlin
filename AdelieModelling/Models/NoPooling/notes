"stanmod_form.R"  - R file that creates a .stan file ("mod.stan") which contains the HMM structure required by stan.
                  - Run this first.
                  - If you wish to change the priors used in the model do so here.

"stanmod_run.R"   - R file that takes the HMM structure ("mod.stan") and implements it into Stan.
                  - Run this second.
                  - If you wish to change the initial values, model settings (i.e. number of states), or data inclusion do so here.

"#id#iters.rds"   - An example model output run previously.
                  - The number of iterations and individuals considered are featured in the title.
                  - Can be drawn into R using readRDS() and then treated like a normal stan output.
