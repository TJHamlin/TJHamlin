You will need to run "stanmod_form" first as this creates "mod.stan" which is a stan file containing the required HMM structure. Following this, run "stanmod_run" to run the HMM through Stan. If you wish to change the priors this will need to be done in "stanmod_form", while changing initial values, parameter settings or data included needs to be done in "stanmod_run".
